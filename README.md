# Bunrise
## TODO

- [ ] Fix jsx-runtime types (JSX.IntrinsicElements...)
- [ ] Make a CLI that compiles + executes the app (no need to make Bun.serve(/* ... */))
- [ ] Read pages as Next.js way /pages/index.ts or /src/pages/index.ts
- [ ] Investigate better alternative to manage the state and events
